:wave: Hey!

Iâ€™m **Sufian Ishaq Khan**. Just your regular ol' developer trying to make a living writing code, dreaming up exceptional solutions to all your software needs using stackoverflow. Lol jk. Or am i? :smiling_imp:

Full Stack .NET developer by day. Maining C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and everything web. (Love working on desktop and mobile applications also :sunglasses:)

**Vue** is the best frontend framework though. This is important to me. Don't argue. Willing to throw hands if argued with. :triumph:
