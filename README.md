* Hi, I’m **Sufian Ishaq Khan**. Just your regular ol' developer trying to make a living writing code, dreaming up exceptional solutions to all your software needs using stackoverflow. Lol jk. Or am i? :D
* Full Stack .NET developer by day. Maining C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and everything web. Also love working on desktop and mobile applications. 
* Vue is the best frontend framework though. This is important to me. Don't argue. Willing to throw hands if argued with. :)
